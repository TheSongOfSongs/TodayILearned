### üìù It is precious to keep records of studying
- My code written before is sort of messy, but it proves I am doing better than yesterday.
- I write down my recording in either [‚ú®Notion‚ú®](https://www.notion.so/Today-I-Learned-f0f446ed48514c4abe709b1d9278dccb) or this repository. (sometimes both though)
