### üìù It is precious to keep records of studying
- My code written before is sort of messy, but it proves I am doing better than yesterday.
- I write down my recording in [‚ú®Notion‚ú®](https://jinhyang.notion.site/2fa22566e5d8448baf9ff8fbd5f5359e?v=3c41946a2a3a4a8c963af9e05373ba11), so this repository just supports notion's articles.
